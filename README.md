I’m a computer scientist focused on **robust, secure, and efficient AI for high-stakes environments** - where ML systems interact with complex software stacks, human operators, or physical hardware.

My work spans:

* Small language models & efficient training/inference
* Autonomous agents for security and system analysis
* RL for robotic locomotion and competitive environments
* End-to-end ML systems: from data collection to deployment and monitoring
